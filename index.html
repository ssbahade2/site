            <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
            <p>I am a research scientist and technology entrepreneur specialising in machine learning, computer vision, and AI-driven healthcare, with a PhD in Computer Science from Swansea University. My research focuses on deep learning for irregular domains, including 2D and 3D biomedical imaging data such as histopathology, immunostained cancer images, and multimodal microscopy datasets. I have published peer-reviewed work on graph neural networks for cell and nuclei detection and segmentation, contributing to advances in cancer image analysis and medical image understanding. My work brings together theory and application, aiming to translate advanced research into practical impact.

            My expertise spans 2D and 3D medical image analysis, geometric deep learning, graph neural networks, multimodal learning, and large-scale data processing. I have developed and applied deep learning models for histopathology, immunostained cancer images, confocal microscopy, and multimodal biological datasets. I also work with modern AI techniques, including large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, vision-language models, and end-to-end machine learning pipelines, alongside traditional computer vision, feature extraction, and predictive modelling. I am particularly interested in multimodal integration, explainable AI, and robust systems for healthcare and life sciences.

            As a postdoctoral researcher supported by the Wellcome Leap Delta Tissue project, I developed image informatics frameworks for analysing complex multi-scale and multimodal imaging data, collaborating closely with clinicians, biologists, and computational scientists to address real clinical challenges.

            Alongside my academic work, I am the founder of Ajivo Pvt. Ltd., where I am building Mindfulness AI, an AI-powered wellbeing platform that combines emotion detection, personalised meditation, mood analytics, and guided mental health support. I lead the full product lifecycle, from system architecture and model development to mobile app deployment, cloud infrastructure, and user experience. The app is published on the Google Play Store and is continuously refined through real user feedback. My startup work reflects a long-term personal mindfulness practice and a commitment to building scalable, human-centred AI systems that support wellbeing and healthcare at scale. I also mentor and build software MVPs for projects across other domains.
