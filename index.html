        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a research scientist and technology entrepreneur specialising in machine learning,
            computer vision, and AI-driven healthcare. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Swansea University,
            where my research focused on deep learning for irregular domains, including 2D and 3D biomedical imaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work spans histopathology, immunostained cancer images, multi-modal microscopy datasets,
            and geometric deep learning methods such as graph neural networks for cell and nuclei detection
            and segmentation. I aim to bridge advanced AI research with real clinical and societal impact.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            My research interests include medical image analysis, geometric deep learning, graph neural networks,
            multimodal learning, explainable AI, and large-scale data processing. I have published peer-reviewed
            work in international journals and conferences and previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher
            supported by the Wellcome Leap Delta Tissue project.
