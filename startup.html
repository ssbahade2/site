      <h2 class="story-title">The Couple Losing Each Other in Daily Stress</h2>
      <p>Sarah and James love each other, but life leaves them exhausted with rushed mornings, work stress and constant parenting. Small things turn into arguments, not because they don't care, but because they both feel unseen and overwhelmed. They don't fall apart, they slowly drift.</p>
      <p>Mindfulness AI can't lighten their schedules, but it helps them pause, breathe and notice what's really happening beneath the sharp words. It reminds them that stress, not lack of love, is the enemy. Ten quiet minutes mindfulness practice together brings them back to warmth, patience and connection.</p>
      <p>Life is still busy, but now they have tools to stay gentle with each other, even on hard days.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="story">
      <h2 class="story-title">The Father Who Can't Switch His Mind Off</h2>
      <p>David is a devoted father who lies awake at night doing quiet maths in his head. Bills, rent, school fees, job security, the pressure of being the provider, it all spins endlessly. By day, the stress leaks into small arguments at home, not from lack of love, but from sheer exhaustion.</p>
      <p>One night, a frightening thought slips in: "They'd be better off without you." He doesn't act on it, but he's shaken, because he realises how easily overwhelming stress can turn into despair.</p>
      <p>Mindfulness AI can't take away his financial responsibilities, but it can sit with him in those private moments, helping him notice rising panic, guiding him through grounding practices, and gently interrupting spirals before they become dangerous. In the quiet hours, when the house is asleep, it reminds him to breathe, to stay, and to take life one manageable moment at a time.</p>

      <h2 class="story-title">The Elder Living with Pain and Loneliness</h2>
      <p>Margaret is 72, and her world has quietly narrowed. Chronic pain slows her steps, most of her friends are gone or distant, and long days pass in a silent flat where the clock feels like company. She watches the park outside her window and thinks of the mornings she once walked there with her husband. Her body aches, and her heart feels forgotten. She isn't suicidal, just tired, often waiting for something to change but unsure what that even means anymore.</p>
      <p>Mindfulness AI can't bring back her husband or take away her illness, but it can offer small moments of real comfort. Gentle practices help her breathe through pain and make space for grief without feeling lost in it. Some days, she even feels a quiet joy she thought was gone forever. And when she joins a guided group session and sees other faces, she remembers she still belongs to the world. It doesn't solve everything, but it gives her dignity, connection, and little moments worth living for again.</p>

    <div class="story">
      <h2 class="story-title">The Person Hit by Sudden Crisis</h2>
      <p>Priya thought she was fine, just stressed and busy, until everything fell apart within two weeks. She lost her job, had to leave her flat, and her mother's illness returned. What used to feel manageable suddenly became panic, sleepless nights, and a quiet shame she never said out loud. Therapy felt too expensive, waiting lists were too long, and she was too exhausted to ask for help.</p>
      <p>If she could find something that felt calm and steady, something that helped her breathe through panic, feel understood instead of judged, and take tiny steps forward, it would be a relief. It wouldn't magically fix her life, but it could help her stay grounded while she slowly rebuilt, supported instead of alone.</p>

    <h2>What All These Stories Have in Common</h2>
    <p>None of these people are weak. They're parents, elders, partners, and ordinary people facing: Financial pressure, Physical illness and aging, Relationship strain, sudden crisis.</p>
    <p>What they share is this: <em>"their minds became too heavy to carry alone."</em></p>
    
    <p>Mindfulness AI is built on one belief:<br>
    <strong>"No one should suffer from emotional pain alone."</strong><br>
    Mental health support should be a right, not a privilege reserved for those who can afford therapy or premium apps.</p>
    
    <div class="cta-section">
      <h2>How You Can Stand with Us</h2>
      <p>If these stories touched you, you can help in three simple ways:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Share the campaign</h3>
      <p>Share it with someone who might be quietly struggling. Every share can reach a life we'll never meet.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Support with what you can</h3>
      <p>If you're able, donate. Even small amounts help keep core features free so that people in real pain don't have to choose between food, bills, and mental health.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Hold the intention</h3>
      <p>If you can't give or share right now, that's okay. Simply hold this wish in your heart:<br>
      <em>"No one should suffer from emotional pain. Everyone deserves a peaceful, happy life."</em></p>
      
      <p>Your compassion matters. Your belief in this mission matters.<br>
      Together, we can make sure help is there in those quiet, desperate moments when someone most needs to feel, "I am not alone."</p>
